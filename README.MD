If you to test the administrator side :

You have to import the SQL database

you can log with : 
email -Admin@outlook.com
password : Admin01 (no space, be careful about uppercases and lowercases )

each account created is set as user. You can modify users's role by being administrator.

In these goods words,
Peace, harmony, eat ramens Kudasai !
